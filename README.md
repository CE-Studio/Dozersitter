# Dozersitter

You've just accepted a job as dozer caretaker! Your job is to keep them all happy through transit by offering boxes to push. It is a dozer's purpose in life to push things, after all! Keep an eye on each dozer's mood to determine which ones are in more need of a box. Be careful, though. The boxes in the truck are cheap and disposable and thus can break easily. Dozers don't like it when boxes break in front of them. Luckily, you have a free supply of boxes that's just a click of the big red button away.
